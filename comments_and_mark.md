In this report “Exploring the Residual Network (ResNet) Architecture” the author studies several claims made in the original paper that proposed deep residual neural networks, concerned with batch normalisation, shortcut connections, identity mappings, and dropout. The report addresses fundamental questions on the architecture of neural networks. 

The introduction clearly articulates research questions and well summarises main results of the study. The research questions are very interesting – they are concerned with studying basic principles of neural network architecture. The work is based on a good selection of research papers that made key contributions in proposing new neural network architectures. The key theoretical concepts are explained briefly. 

The solution concept is based on implementing and evaluating performance of residual neural networks by carefully choosing their architecture and evaluating their performance with and without certain key components. The approach taken in the report is based on formulating interesting hypothesis and carefully testing them through numerical evaluations. 

The implementation is based on using TensorFlow Keras library. The code is well structured and commented throughout. 

The dataset is CIFAR-10 which contains 60,000 32x32 colour images of 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. This is a standard dataset used for image classification. The dataset is of limited size in comparison to other datasets, such as ImageNet, but is a suitable choice for the purposes of this project. 

The numerical evaluation includes standard training and testing loss and accuracy curves versus the number of epochs for different model configurations (e.g. with or without batch normalisation). Some results indicate overfitting, but this is noted and discussed in the report. The numerical evaluation is thorough and well complemented with discussions and providing plausible explanations. 

Conclusion provides a good summary of the results. The results are summarised in a table with all the key performance indicators listed. A detailed discussions of research questions is presented.

The presentation is of high quality. The report is well structured, with individual section containing information that should be covered. 

The report indicates a very through work addressing a set of fundamental and interesting research questions. Well done for this work !
